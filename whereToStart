Where to start? Here. This goes from a deeply recognized zero.
First choose a plan.
I've choosen this one: Introduction, My Development Environment, Interfaces and Widgets. 

INTRODUCTION
1. Developing with Flutter
2. What is Flutter?
3. Dart and Flutter.
4. Dart Syntaxis
5. Flutter for Android and iOS developers
6. Flutter for React Native developers (<--I'm not sure about this)
7. What to expect from an app built with Flutter?
8. Test your knowledge: Try to explain Flutter to a not developer person and get feedback until the feedback is positive.

MY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
9. What to install?
10. Installing Android Studio and Visual Studio Code or not?
11. A project with Flutter

INTERFACES AND WIDGETS
This is blury at this point so I'm going to leave it this way...
